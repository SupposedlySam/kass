"""Join dictation phrases that were cut at pauses.

Streaming dictation recognizes and refines each phrase on its own, so every
phrase would otherwise come back punctuated as a finished sentence. A pause is
a breath, not a sentence end: phrases stay open while dictation continues and
the seam between two phrases is decided once the next one arrives.

Whisper is given the earlier text when it recognizes a phrase, so the casing of
its first word says whether the speaker continued the sentence. A capitalized
first word is only treated as a new sentence when it is a common sentence
opener; anything else is assumed to be a name continuing the sentence.

A lowercase first word from Whisper reliably continues the sentence; a capital
does not reliably start one. ``continue_phrase`` lowercases it only for a
common word (``_common_word``). Names stay capitalized, including any the user
capitalizes mid-sentence elsewhere.

Streaming cleanup now sees a whole open sentence at a time
(sentence_tail.py), so joins happen only where a long tail is settled
mid-sentence. Before cleanup, ``strip_pause_mark``, ``continue_after_seam``
and ``continue_phrase`` remove the ending and capital Whisper gives a phrase
only because the audio paused.
