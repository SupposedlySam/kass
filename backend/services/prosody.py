"""How something was said: pitch, loudness and pace (docs/plans/EXPRESSIVE_DICTATION.md).

``PitchTrack`` follows the voice as the audio arrives, 10 ms frames analysed
in 100 ms chunks (well under a millisecond each), so nothing waits on it after
release. ``measure`` puts it together with the words' times (word_timing.py):
per sentence how high, how varied and how loud the voice was, and the words
that were drawn out ("wayyy").

Everything is relative to the speaker. A sentence's ``energy`` is how far
above their own statements its pitch level, pitch range and loudness are, in
spreads of each (``Baseline``); stretched words are measured against the
recording's own pace.

Phase 1 only measures: the numbers are saved with the capture for review and
tuning, and the text is never changed.
