"""How a speaker writes the way things were said, learned from their own edits.

Phase 4 of docs/plans/EXPRESSIVE_DICTATION.md. The defaults are strict: not
everyone wants "!" or "wayyy" from their voice, and a loose default would push
them on people who never asked. A speaker who wants more shows it by editing
their text, in Captures or by voice:

- A period they change to "!" on a sentence they said with some energy
  lowers their "!" cutoff toward it. A "!" they change back raises it.
- A word they write drawn out ("way" to "wayyy") teaches what their own
  stretches sound like; one they write plainly again stops it.

The rule never moves on one edit, and never so far that more than a few of
the speaker's own plain sentences or words would change. Learning goes on
with "Write how it was said" off; only applying it waits for the switch.

Everything is read again from the saved measurements (``captures.prosody``)
and reports when a dictation starts, so a withdrawn report stops teaching at
once.
