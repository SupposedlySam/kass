"""Short rules summarized from the user's older examples.

Cleanup shows the model only the most recent examples, so without this an
example would stop counting once enough newer ones pushed it out. When enough
examples have left the prompt, an idle-time job has the cleanup model fold
them into the notes it already has: a bounded list of plain rules such as
"Write Herga as one word." Every cleanup reads the same notes, so the
cached prompt still matches until they change.

A new version is kept only when replaying the user's own examples with it
comes out no further from what they meant than with the current notes. If it
does worse, each new rule is tried on its own and kept only when it helps, so
a bad rule from a small model cannot make cleanup worse or sink good ones. Either way the folded
examples are marked considered, and the corrections stay recorded for the
personal model.

Each writing style (styles.py) has its own notes, summarized from its own
examples. ``style`` arguments are style ids; None is the default style.

Everything is local: one JSON file in the data directory.
