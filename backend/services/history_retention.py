"""History retention: delete old captures without forgetting what they taught.

Captures older than the user's window (``CaptureSettings.history_retention_days``,
0 keeps them forever) are deleted with their audio at startup and every hour.
Before a capture goes, everything learned from it moves somewhere that lasts
(docs/plans/HISTORY_RETENTION.md):

- its corrections stay, with the app and style they teach copied onto them
  and their audio moved to the correction audio folder (unless the user keeps
  no recordings, audio_retention.py);
- usage stats get a ``RetiredCapture`` row of its numbers;
- the names it wrote go into ``KnownName``.

Each batch folds and deletes in one transaction, so a crash leaves the
captures as they were, and a folded capture is deleted in the same commit, so
it is never folded twice. Audio files go after the commit; a crash before
then leaves files with no capture, which the next sweep deletes once they are
older than the window.

Nothing is deleted until the user confirms the window
(``history_retention_confirmed``): saving the setting does, and so does
answering the dialog the app shows at launch while old captures are waiting.
With nothing old to delete there is nothing to ask, so it confirms itself.

The newest capture, the current take, is never deleted, nor one being
refined or retranscribed (``in_use``).
