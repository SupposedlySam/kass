"""When a trained voice adapter may replace the current speech model.

Rows come from ``train.evaluate``: each test take transcribed clean, with a
person talking 6 and 0 dB below the user, and with room noise 5 dB below,
by plain turbo ("base"), the model in use ("production", absent when that
is plain turbo) and the candidate. Corrected takes, when there are any, are
rows with condition "correction". A candidate passes only if:

- it makes clearly fewer mistakes than the model in use with talk and noise,
- clean takes are no worse than with plain turbo or the model in use (0.5% of
  words allowed, or 3% when it cuts noisy mistakes by a quarter or more),
- the user's corrected takes are no worse,
- it's no slower and uses no more memory.
