"""Adapters Kass trains and ships inside the app (docs/plans/SHARED_ADAPTERS.md).

A new Mac starts from them: cleanup uses the shared cleanup adapter for its
model size, and recognition merges the shared voice adapter into turbo,
until the Mac's own training activates a personal adapter. Personal training
continues from the shared adapter, and a personal adapter built that way
records which one (its ``shared`` id). With the setting off, Kass uses the
stock models and the personal adapters that aren't built on a shared one.

Each adapter folder holds ``shared.json``, written by
scripts/shared-adapters/publish.py: its id, and for cleanup the pipeline and
flags it was tested with. A cleanup adapter tested with another pipeline is
never used, so a release that changes cleanup must retrain it.
