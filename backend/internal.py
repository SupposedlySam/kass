"""
Internal features: they ship in every release but only run on the developer's
own builds, before they're ready for beta users.

scripts/install.sh writes an empty `internal` file into the data dir, so
every build installed from a checkout has them and the release DMG doesn't.
Delete the file to turn them off. It's read on every check, so the change
applies without restarting the server.

Add a name to INTERNAL_FEATURES and gate the feature with `enabled(name)`.
To move it to beta, remove the name: every check still using it then raises,
which shows what to change. The app keeps its own list in
app/src/lib/internalFeatures.ts.
