//! `kass://` links: open a screen in the main window from outside the
//! app, e.g. `kass://captures?capture=<id>` from a review doc.
//!
//! macOS delivers the link as `RunEvent::Opened` (the scheme is registered by
//! `CFBundleURLTypes` in Info.plist, so only an installed build receives
//! them). A link can arrive before the main window has loaded, when it is
//! what launched the app, so the latest one is also kept until the frontend
//! takes it.
