//! Global hotkey → dictation effect bridge.
//!
//! Thin adapter from `keytap::chord::ChordMatcher` to Tauri events. keytap
//! owns the OS event tap + the chord state machine (Momentary vs Toggle,
//! longest-match resolution, sticky-toggle semantics); this module's only
//! job is:
//!
//!   1. Build a `ChordMatcher` from the user's saved PTT, Toggle and
//!      Command chords.
//!   2. Translate `ChordEvent` → kass's [`Effect`] on a dispatcher
//!      thread.
//!   3. Fan [`Effect`]s out into native dictation (microphone + streaming,
//!      see `dictation/`) and dictate-window show.
//!
//! The [`Effect::RestartRecording`] signal is emitted when keytap fires
//! `End(PTT)` and `Start(Toggle)` with the *same* [`Instant`] — which
//! happens when the held set upgrades from a shorter chord to a longer
//! superset in a single event (the classic PTT→hands-free transition).
//! We detect the pair with a 5 ms peek on the matcher's receiver and
//! coalesce into one `Restart` so hosts can discard the transition-
//! moment audio rather than treat it as an unrelated Stop+Start pair.
//!
//! Left- and right-hand modifier variants are kept distinct all the way
//! down to the OS event tap (keytap's core promise). Defaults bind to
//! right-hand Cmd + right-hand Option so the usual left-hand shortcuts
//! stay with the OS / app.
//!
//! Escape cancels a take ([`dictation::cancel`]). It is watched on a second
//! tap of its own: in the matcher, a held chord (longest match) or a latched
//! toggle would hide it. The tap only observes, so Escape still reaches the
//! focused app too.
